# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer Segmentation is a Machine Learning project that groups customers based on similar characteristics such as annual income and spending behavior. This helps businesses understand customer patterns and design targeted marketing strategies.

This project uses **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to divide customers into meaningful segments.
